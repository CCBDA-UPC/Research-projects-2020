# Homework research project

One of the objectives of the **homework research project** is to study a little bit in-depth a subject that draws your attention and interest related to Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics. It is a common practice in computer science where professionals regularly need to **increase their knowledge on new topics that they might need to use for their daily work**.

During the research, you need to be able _to find reliable and trustworthy sources of information_, understand them and try to invest as much or as little time as necessary to decide whether you are going to spend more time learning about the subject.

Another of the objectives of this homework assignment is to **cooperate and share your knowledge** with your peers and help each other to be able to have a broader understanding of Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics. Therefore, to focus your research, I would like you to think about the information that you will be sharing from your classmates perspective _(use the following ideas to center your research focus not like the report index)_:

*   What would you like to know about the presented topic to be able to decide if it is worth going in-depth or stop and take a different approach?
*   What do people say regarding the subject you are studying: is it very successful? Is it mature enough? Do many people praise or criticize it?
*   What has been your personal experience regarding the subject? What lessons have you learned?
*   Share some relevant sources of information to learn more about the topic (URLs of websites, Articles, Blogs, PDF files, online courses, etc.)

A final objective of this assignment is to be able to **share the information attractively and concisely**. You can't expect your audience to invest lots of time on a topic that may not be of interest. Therefore I encourage you to deliver a short, meaningful, and attractive **tutorial**.

## Instructions to deliver the assigment

For **every team of 5 people**, **two of them** will be preparing a tutorial on a  process. It can be something that they are using for their course project or that they are interested in digging a bit further.

To have more variety on the topics covered, *please contact your teacher before beginning preparing the tutorial*.

Groups of two people need to create a folder in their project repo named "research" and then a  `"/research/tutorial/README.md"` file with the explanations, images, pieces of code, etc. similar to the ones used for your laboratory sessions.

The **three remaining** team members will be randomly assigned two tutorials elaborated by some other teams. They will need to follow the tutorial and submit evidence of their job in `"/research/response1/README.md"` and `"/research/response2/README.md"` including **feedback for the authors** and **their grade** on how well elaborated and interesting they find it.

Add a file `"/research/authors.json"` 

```json5
{ 
    "creators" : [ 
        "NAME1@est.fib.upc.edu",
        "NAME2@est.fib.upc.edu"
        ],
    "validators": [
        "NAME3@est.fib.upc.edu",
        "NAME4@est.fib.upc.edu",
        "NAME5@est.fib.upc.edu" 
        ]
}
```

The teacher will evaluate the tutorials based on his criteria and the feedback offered by the groups of 3 students.
Once all tutorials evaluated, they will be included in this repository to make them available for everyone.
